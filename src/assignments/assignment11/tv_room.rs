//! TV Room Simulator.
//!
//! People can come to the TV room and watch TV. There are two types of TV watchers, manager and guest.
//!
//! The rule of the TV room is as follows:
//!
//! - Closed TV room can be opened by the manager.
//! - Guests can enter the TV room by the manager.
//! - Manager can leave the TV room earlier than guests.
//! - The TV room closes when the last person left the TV room.
//!
//! Both `Manager` and `Guest` have `Rc<Watcher>` as a field, and its reference count indicates the number of people in
//! the TV room. When the 'Manager' and 'Guest' object is dropped, it means that the person leaves the TV room.
//!
//! Consult the following documentations:
//! - <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-04-rc.html#rct-the-reference-counted-smart-pointer>
//! - <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt>
//!
//! Refer `tv_room_grade.rs` for test cases.
